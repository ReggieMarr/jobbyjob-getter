Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent
I am excited to submit my application for the R\&D Engineer position at Ansys. As an experienced Embedded Software Designer with a deep passion for technology and innovation, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your team and bring the transformative potential of simulation to life.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent
My experience at L3Harris-Wescam has provided me with a strong foundation in software development, particularly with C++ and parallel computing, which I believe align perfectly with the requirements of this role. I've led a number of challenging projects, including the development of a confidential LIDAR-adjacent project which earned me the 2023 EO Engineering and Technology Award. This experience not only honed my programming skills but also deepened my understanding of solving complex problems and working collaboratively with diverse teams.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent
Further, my experience in developing data distribution pipelines, abstracting various protocols, and designing device driver frameworks would be valuable in handling the responsibilities of the R\&D Engineer role. With an innate ability to learn quickly and adapt, I am keen to employ best practices and delve into the design, implementation, maintenance, testing, and documentation of Ansys' software modules and subsystems.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent
One of the things that excites me about Ansys is your commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology through simulation.
In my experience working with complex systems I've found the use of SIL and HIL testing paired with simulators of various levels of complexity to be extremely useful. Additionally I believe that my values, coupled with my passion for science and technology, would enable me to contribute positively to your team and create high-quality production code.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent
I am eager to bring my blend of experience, technical expertise, and passion for innovation to Ansys. I am confident that my skills and interests align with your requirements, and I am excited about the possibility of contributing to your team.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my candidacy further.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Best regards,

\vspace{0.2cm}

Reginald Marr

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:org70f258b}


I am first and foremost most proud of my ability to collaborate with my peers across a variety of disciplines (and across a variety of physical locations) to produce something better than the sum of our individual contributions.\\
Additionally I pride myself on my ability to grind away at complex problems, break them down, and define their atomic components.\\
By doing this I am able to develop robust solutions which solve not just the specific task at hand but provide adaptability to solve the problem in a general sense.\\

I am forever keen to learn, adapt and grow.\\

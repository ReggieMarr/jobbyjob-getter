** What is this
This is a repo used to track my resume and associated latex/elisp so that I can get me a real gud jobby job.
This is heavily inspired by [[https://gitlab.com/Titan-C/org-cv][Org CV]] and [[https://www.aidanscannell.com/post/org-mode-resume/][this blog post.]]
I really like the idea of writing my resume (and other documents) in org with minimal latex in the document.
Eventualy I'd like to create a common elisp layer since it doesn't really seem like each template uses a lot of potentially common code.
** Config
I use emacs to generate this stuff
*** Dependencies
+ Emacs (the [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][doomed]] kind).
+ xelatex (to compile awesome-fonts)
+ The following manjaro latex-related packages:
  - ~texlive-formatsextra~
  - ~texlive-fontsextra~
  - ~latex-sourcesanspro-font~
  - ~texlive-fonts-fontawesome~
  - ~texlive-latexextra~
  - ~texlive-bibtexextra~
  - ~texlive-core~
*** Elisp
+ ~packages.el~
    #+begin_src elisp
        (package! ox-moderncv
        :recipe (:host gitlab :repo "Titan-C/org-cv"))
    #+end_src
    Note that there are a couple patches I've applied to this which I've tracked as [[file:export_and_quote.patch][export_and_quote.patch]]
+ ~config.el~
    #+begin_src elisp
    (use-package! ox-moderncv
        :load-path "~/.emacs.d/.local/straight/repos/org-cv/"
        :init (require 'ox-moderncv))

    (use-package! ox-awesomecv
        :load-path "~/.emacs.d/.local/straight/repos/org-cv/"
        :init (require 'ox-awesomecv))

    (use-package! ox-altacv
        :load-path "~/.emacs.d/.local/straight/repos/org-cv/"
        :init (require 'ox-moderncv))

    #+end_src
*** Latex
I use [[https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV][awesomecv]] and [[https://github.com/Titan-C/moderncv][moderncv]] as two pretty sick templates.
They need to be symlinked to the same directory as resume.org for this to work.
